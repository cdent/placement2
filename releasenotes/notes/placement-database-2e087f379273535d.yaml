    An optional configuration group placement_database can be used in
    nova.conf to configure a separate database for use with the placement
    API.

    If placement_database.connection has a value this will be used as the
    connection URL for the placement database. That database will be
    a replica of the tables used in the API datbase. It will be created and
    synchronized when the 'nova-manage api_db sync' command is run.

    When the setting is None the existing settings for the api_database
    will be used for hosting placement API data.
